\paragraph{Problem 1:} 
Show that PPAD \(\subseteq\) PPP. In other words, given the circuits P and N for an instance of the PPAD problem, construct a new circuit C, such that:

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item If \(\exists \)x with C(x) = \(0^n\), then \(0^n\) was not unbalanced in the original PPAD instance.
    \item Given \(x \neq y\), with C(x) = C(y), we can find in polynomial time a \(z \neq 0^n\) (hint: possibly equal to x or y) that is unbalanced in the original PPAD instance.
\end{enumerate}

```

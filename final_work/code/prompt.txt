We now highlight a key difference between an EF1 allocation and an EFX allocation. From the algorithm of Lipton et al.~\cite{10.1145/988772.988792}, it is clear that given an EF1 allocation on a set $M_0$ of goods, one can determine an EF1 allocation on $M_0 \cup M_1$, for any $M_1 \subseteq M \setminus M_0$, by simply adding goods from $M_1$ one-by-one to the existing bundles and changing the owners (if necessary) in a clever way. Intuitively, we never need to cut or merge the bundles formed in any EF1 allocation. We can just append the unallocated goods appropriately to the current bundles.
